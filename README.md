# Vet_Clinic Database

> Welcome to the Vet Clinic Database Project repository, your comprehensive solution for effective veterinary clinic management. This project is designed to streamline the organization and management of essential animal information within a veterinary clinic setting. Built with a tech stack tailored to database management, this project empowers veterinary professionals to efficiently track, analyze, and manage their patients' data.


## Getting Started

- Use [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Use [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**

## 🔭 Future Features <a name="future-features"></a>


- [ ] **[User Authentication and Authorization]  Implement user authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized veterinary professionals can access and manipulate the database. This could involve user roles, access levels, and secure login systems.**
- [ ] **[Medical Records Integration] Extend the database to include a table for storing medical records of animals. This could include vaccination history, treatment details, diagnoses, and prescribed medications. These records would provide a comprehensive overview of an animal's health.**
- [ ] **[Appointment Scheduling] Add a module for appointment scheduling and tracking. Veterinary staff could schedule appointments for check-ups, surgeries, and treatments, making it easier to manage patient flow and resources.**
